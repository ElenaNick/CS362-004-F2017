Adventurer Card.

	#1. The card will pull any 2 non-gold cards from the deck instead of searching for the first 2 treasury cards
		Description: any non-treasury card in the deck will be counted as such due to a "|| cardDrawn!=gold" 
					clause on line 19. And a gold card will never be counted as a treasury card due to the same 
					clause. Therefore, instead of moving first 2 treasury cards found in the deck to the hand, 
					the first 2 cards other than gold will be moved to the hand.
		On the line 19 of my teammate's dominion.c file:
			if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn != gold)
		It should be coded as following:
			if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
		Test case: initialize the game state so  that the player has no treasury cards in hand, deck, or discard. 
				   call the cardEffect() function for an adventurer card. 
				   Check hand and deck counts, as well as hand content
			
	#2 3 treasury cards will be moved to the hand instead of 2.
		Description: the loop to search for a treasury card in the deck will continue untill maximum of 3 treasury cards
					will be found due to a bug on line 12.
		On the line 12 of my teammate's dominion.c file:
			while(drawntreasure<=2){
		It should be coded as following:
			while(drawntreasure<2){					
		Test case: initialize the game state so that player's deck consists of 5 silver cards
				   call the cardEffect() function for an adventurer card. 
				   Check hand and deck counts, as well as hand content				

Smithy Card.

	#1 Two cards are drawn from the deck instead of three
		Description: as a result of bug in loop counter initialization on line 39, the loop is executed only 2 times.
					Therefore, only 2 cards are drawn from the deck instead of 3.
		On the line 39 of the dominion.c:
			for (i = 1; i < 3; i++)
		It should be coded as following:
			for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)		
		Test case: initialize the game state so that player's deck consists 5 cards
				   call the cardEffect() function for an adventurer card. 
				   Check hand and deck counts
